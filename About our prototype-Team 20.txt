We have finished the prototype,and the function we implements are as follows:
We use 4 activities in the prototype,which are MainActivity,HomePageCustomer,PackageInformationList and PackageOperationPanelTemp,transmission can be done through these activities.
8 XML files which could display different interface are designed,and they have been linked to their appointed java files.
We use 1 list as well as 1 list adapter in PackageInformationList,it displayed items for users.
We treat PackageOperationPanelTemp as a platform to launch several fragments,these fragments includes:PackageOperationPanel,sub-fragments PackageDetailInfo,PackageLocation and EndTransaction,4 fragments in total.
We use 1 listfragment in TransactionHistory,which will show the items in a list in order to help users find their commercial history.
Apart from that.
We link location system to the Internet successfully.
Also,we establish localization in Chinese.

Among all the use case,register,login,Modify user's information,assessment system are not achieved,and for the end transaction function and detail history,we only present its interface.
